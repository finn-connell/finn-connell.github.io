  <h2 class= "orange-heading-2">Some Pre-Bootcamp Thoughts</h2>
  <div class="text-box-fill">
    <p>
      Heading into bootcamp my long-term goals remain the same. I’m heartened by the new skills I’ve developed and the discussions I’ve had with a few others in my cohort. I’m not yet sure exactly where I’ll end up following bootcamp, but I’d still like to end up somewhere with a focus on creating things that enhance people’s lives rather than just suck them away. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that my strengths are going to serve me well during bootcamp. I’m happy with how my approach to learning has allowed me to pick up skills like JavaScript quickly, and I’m feeling confident with my standing in regards to my technical abilities at this time. I’m really looking forward to improving on these skills in bootcamp. I think that my main obstacle is going to be working within the rhythm and structure of bootcamp. Although I’m very disciplined with my productivity, the way in which I work still relies on doing things at my own pace. Once I have an idea in my mind I usually have to implement it immediately, or else I can find it very difficult to focus. I think that a mixture of working with this and overcoming it will be instrumental in succeeding in bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of non-technical skills, what I would really like to develop are skills like being a more empathetic listener, as well as skills for effective leadership. I think that I am a good collaborator, but in my broader life, people will look to me for leadership and I’ll usually abdicate it due to laziness or lack of self-confidence if I’m able. This is something that I would like to change, especially because ineffective leadership is one of the things that frustrates me most about others.

    </p>
    <p>
      The main thing that I expect from the bootcamp team is respect. When I’ve had difficulties in education environments in the past it’s been related to a perceived lack of institutional respect for students, which in my view manifests in problems like shortcomings in pastoral care and unreasonable administrative rigidity. I think that this is unlikely to become a problem at boot camp because of the relatively small cohort size, which hopefully will lead to the formation of robust relationships. I’m going to make every effort to complete the tasks I commit myself to, work with others in a way that reflects my values, and engage with all aspects of the course as best I can, especially the ones I find difficult.

  <h2 class="orange-heading-2">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  <p class="text-box-fill">I would like to be able to use the web development skill set in an arts-adjacent environment , to assist creatives with creating and managing
     a unique online presence. I think that the ecosystem of expressive web pages has been undermined by content-aggregating sites, and a return 
     to a more classic model of a user-created web could be important to the future of marketing and the arts. I also would like to develop my back-end
      software development skills to potentially utilize in conjunction with my design and asset-creation skills in a field like game development.
  </p>
  <h2 class="orange-heading-2">My Strengths and Limitations</h2>
  <p class="text-box-fill">My key strengths are the ability to think critically about information and the desire to be challenged.  
    This means I’m usually pretty successful when dealing with a lot of new information and developing my set of skills. I enjoy the experience of getting 
    to grips with a lot of different processes. My main limitation is struggling with boredom. I find it very difficult to work on a task if I don’t
   feel that it's extending my skills or can’t see a point to its completion. I prefer to fail repeatedly at a challenging task than to succeed repeatedly
    at a menial one.
  </p>
  <h2 class="orange-heading-2">What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p class="text-box-fill">The two skills I’m looking forward to developing are my self-management in regards to project planning and timeboxing. I’m usually
     pretty good at hitting my targets, but I think that I could gain a lot from a more disciplined approach when it comes to these things in regards to the way
     I work and develop my own creative pursuits. I think that timeboxing as a skill has a lot of potential for defeating the “tyranny of the blank page”.	 	
  </p>
  <h2 class="orange-heading-2">Managing My Workload</h2>
  <div class="text-box-fill">
    <p>So far I’ve been tackling foundations content on a schedule similar to full time work, commencing before 8:30am, taking smoko and lunch at 10:30am 
      and 1:30pm respectively, and finishing up at 4:30 or 5pm. I’ve been a little bit lenient with my break times so I can fit in a longer run at least a 
      couple of times a week to prepare for the WU2K ultramarathon in July. 
    </p>
    <p>When working with others I try to be courteous and respectful of other people’s backgrounds and views. I understand that most people hold very strong 
      views nowadays because of a variety of pressures on our information ecology, and I think that tolerance of others with beliefs contrary to our own is 
      essential to productivity. I also try to be as transparent as possible when it comes to planning and committing to the delivery of projects, which is a 
      courtesy I expect returned by those I work with.
    </p>
    <p>I also think managing my workload when it becomes difficult to handle is an important skill. When faced with technical challenges, I usually follow 
      a process wherein I first attempt to handle the problem myself, followed by looking for relevant information from those who’ve experienced similar difficulties 
      online, and finally contacting the facilitators or my peers for help. I think that this is a good protocol to follow because it encourages self-driven problem 
      solving before asking for assistance, which is an effective way to learn independently, but doesn’t neglect the wealth of knowledge that others have to share. 
    </p>
    <p>I expect the facilitation team to make the course content as accessible as they reasonably can, to make progression through the course content as efficient 
      as possible, and to help mediate a suitable solution should any significant obstacles arise. 
    </p>
    <p>I’ve made an effort to clear my schedule as much as possible, especially for the duration of bootcamp. If I can, I’d like to maintain my training schedule for 
      running and boxing, because I think that incorporating physical activity into my schedule generates a big boost in my focus and productivity. I’ll be trying 
      my best to keep things flexible in order to devote as much time as needed to the course.
