  <h1 class="orange-heading">My Learning Plan</h1>
  <h2 class="orange-heading-2">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  <p class="text-box-fill">I would like to be able to use the web development skill set in an arts-adjacent environment , to assist creatives with creating and managing
     a unique online presence. I think that the ecosystem of expressive web pages has been undermined by content-aggregating sites, and a return 
     to a more classic model of a user-created web could be important to the future of marketing and the arts. I also would like to develop my back-end
      software development skills to potentially utilize in conjunction with my design and asset-creation skills in a field like game development.
  </p>
  <h2 class="orange-heading-2">My Strengths and Limitations</h2>
  <p class="text-box-fill">My key strengths are the ability to think critically about information and the desire to be challenged.  
    This means I’m usually pretty successful when dealing with a lot of new information and developing my set of skills. I enjoy the experience of getting 
    to grips with a lot of different processes. My main limitation is struggling with boredom. I find it very difficult to work on a task if I don’t
   feel that it's extending my skills or can’t see a point to its completion. I prefer to fail repeatedly at a challenging task than to succeed repeatedly
    at a menial one.
  </p>
  <h2 class="orange-heading-2">What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p class="text-box-fill">The two skills I’m looking forward to developing are my self-management in regards to project planning and timeboxing. I’m usually
     pretty good at hitting my targets, but I think that I could gain a lot from a more disciplined approach when it comes to these things in regards to the way
     I work and develop my own creative pursuits. I think that timeboxing as a skill has a lot of potential for defeating the “tyranny of the blank page”.

  <h2 class="orange-heading-2">Managing My Workload</h2>
  <div class="text-box-fill">
    <p>So far I’ve been tackling foundations content on a schedule similar to full time work, commencing before 8:30am, taking smoko and lunch at 10:30am 
      and 1:30pm respectively, and finishing up at 4:30 or 5pm. I’ve been a little bit lenient with my break times so I can fit in a longer run at least a 
      couple of times a week to prepare for the WU2K ultramarathon in July. 
    </p>
    <p>When working with others I try to be courteous and respectful of other people’s backgrounds and views. I understand that most people hold very strong 
      views nowadays because of a variety of pressures on our information ecology, and I think that tolerance of others with beliefs contrary to our own is 
      essential to productivity. I also try to be as transparent as possible when it comes to planning and committing to the delivery of projects, which is a 
      courtesy I expect returned by those I work with.
    </p>
    <p>I also think managing my workload when it becomes difficult to handle is an important skill. When faced with technical challenges, I usually follow 
      a process wherein I first attempt to handle the problem myself, followed by looking for relevant information from those who’ve experienced similar difficulties 
      online, and finally contacting the facilitators or my peers for help. I think that this is a good protocol to follow because it encourages self-driven problem 
      solving before asking for assistance, which is an effective way to learn independently, but doesn’t neglect the wealth of knowledge that others have to share. 
    </p>
    <p>I expect the facilitation team to make the course content as accessible as they reasonably can, to make progression through the course content as efficient 
      as possible, and to help mediate a suitable solution should any significant obstacles arise. 
    </p>
    <p>I’ve made an effort to clear my schedule as much as possible, especially for the duration of bootcamp. If I can, I’d like to maintain my training schedule for 
      running and boxing, because I think that incorporating physical activity into my schedule generates a big boost in my focus and productivity. I’ll be trying 
      my best to keep things flexible in order to devote as much time as needed to the course. 
    </p>
