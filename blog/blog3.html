    <h1 class="orange-heading">Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <p class="text-box-fill"> EQ, or emotional quotient, is a conceptual measure of an individual’s emotional intelligence. 
      This is distinct from IQ, or intelligence quotient, in that it seeks to quantify a different selection of cognitive traits.

    Emotional intelligence is considered to be an overall measure of one’s self-management and interpersonal skills. Self-awareness, self-regulation, 
    awareness of others emotions, empathy, and communicating in ways appropriate in a given emotional context are some of the key skills that comprise 
    emotional intelligence. The cultivation of these traits can improve interpersonal relationships and self-satisfaction, as well as being an essential 
    skill set for effective leadership. While IQ measures a set of cognitive traits that are broadly useful across all fields, the traits measured by EQ pertain 
    more to an individual’s metacognitive faculties. The ability to analyze one’s own cognitive habits and develop them into more useful ones requires the ability 
    to recognize the sensations and triggering stimuli or thought patterns of different emotional states.
