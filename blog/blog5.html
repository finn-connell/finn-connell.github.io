    <h1 class = "orange-heading">Reflections on Core Learning</h1>

    <h2 class = "orange-heading-2">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <div class="text-box-fill">
      The things I have learned about myself are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>I find it more difficult to emotionally self-examine than to cognitively self-examine.</li>
        <li>I get frustrated when I feel like I can’t articulate my ideas concisely to others.</li>
        <li>I sometimes feel more able to experiment with a problem and iterate upon solutions when working alone.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="orange-heading-2">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p class="text-box-fill">
      I think that when designing an app it’s important to respect the end user. Many of the software products that people frequently use in my view fail in this simple but essential principle. For example, most social media apps now incorporate short-form video aggregating “attention traps” into their services as a proven way to generate revenue, even when this isn’t really a part of their core service. I think that practices like this, or the kind of algorithmic content aggregation that is designed to drive engagement metrics, and increasingly displays ideologically extreme or outrage-baiting content are outcomes of developing software without values, empathy, or self-awareness. When this type of amoral software design is present in large-scale platforms, it ends up placing immense pressures on the way our cultural outputs are designed and consumed, distorting the ways we perceive the world and explain it to one-another. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="orange-heading-2">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p class = "text-box-fill">
      I was surprised to learn that there was a neurological basis for a growth mindset’s effectiveness as a learning tool. Intuitively, a growth mindset seems naturally effective simply as a series of cognitive behaviors, but learning about some of the neuroplasticity research that underpins this principle was really interesting. It makes me wonder what other behaviors have a strong neurological basis.  
    </p>
    <h2 class="orange-heading-2">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p class="text-box-fill">
      As I mentioned previously, being able to accurately take stock of my emotional state in order to implement some more positive behaviors and attitudes is quite difficult. I think that most of us become used to repressing our emotions in one way or another, and while this serves some function in helping us to relate to others in ways that aren’t entirely predicated on our emotions, it can also make it tough to be honest with ourselves.
    </p>
    <h2 class="orange-heading-2">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p class="text-box-fill">
      I think that the human skills component of the program here is analogous to the old principle of “civilizing the engineers”. It’s a peculiar aberration of the division of labor that we expect people to train to solve human problems without ever necessarily encountering the people faced with the issue at hand. It’s important that people who work in these areas develop their human skills, because even if they aren’t human-facing, the things they create will be. I think that given the immense role that software plays in modern life, without developers who are concerned with the humanity of others, it inevitably becomes a bleak and inhuman oppressor.
    </p>
    <h2 class="orange-heading-2">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h2>
    <p class="text-box-fill">
      I think it would be hasty to call the human skills component a waste of time. A lot of people with the sort of sensibility that I have may do so because they are much more likely to encounter frustration when examining and applying their soft skills than their hard skills. I think that a large swathe of people who are interested in computers and working as programmers probably like certainty the way that I do, and human skills are kind of the antithesis of this. This alone is probably enough to make human skills worth examining.
