    <div class="text-box-fill">
    <p>I’m very fortunate to come from a household that values education. In a cruel twist of fate, I endured a childhood almost entirely without the entertainment and comfort of television. This meant I had to either make my own fun (lame) or read a book (also lame). The latter option was generally the child-me’s preference, which led to his grotesquely distended vocabulary and the vexation of many educators. Although this resulted in much precociousness (not to mention a twelve-year-old with delusions of grandeur) I think ultimately this turned out for the best.</p>
    <p>Once you get past the derision of classmates and co-workers for speaking like the omniscient narrator in an especially dry 19th century high-society drama, there are actually some benefits to being this way. For one, I’ve found the ability to reckon with the abstract, understand authorial intent and think critically about the perspectives offered in texts and conversations pretty handy (even more so nowadays, given that a great deal of written language is probably some combination of spin and outright falsehoods). I also like to think that I understand the utility of information, and the cultivation of the kind of metacognitive skills used to unpack and analyze it. I think that these are probably the best and most useful products of the culture I was raised in.</p>
    <p>The other thing I value is tenacity. I’m never really sure whether this is a trait that I actually possess, or whether I simply derive some kind of masochistic pleasure from forcing myself to do difficult things. Maybe that’s the secret to tenacity, and everyone is just too worried about getting kink-shamed to admit it? Anyways, that’s neither here nor there. The fact of the matter is that I think persisting when things get challenging is pretty much the baseline skill required before you can begin to even contemplate success in any field. People often ask me how I can “do so many things”, referring usually to some combination of making music, distance running, amateur boxing, sewing, boat-building and cross-dressing. There are actually two answers to this question, the first being that although I do all of those things, I do none of them particularly effectively except for cross-dressing, and the second being that I do them all in a state of perpetual difficulty without throwing in the towel. When I tell people this, they seem unconvinced, but I think that everyone can benefit from trying to find fun in attempting things in which success will be hard-won. </p>
    <p>There is another side to this coin, however; if you have any semblance of reading comprehension beyond that of a debatably sentient sea sponge you may have come to the conclusion that whomever is writing this barely-comprehensible ramble may be a little neurotic. I could protest this notion, become indignant, or hastily try to amend the conversational (and perhaps slightly flirtatious) tone of this blog post. Unfortunately, to do any of these things would be disingenuous. The worst symptom of this neuroticism is that, while I’m usually able to channel my constantly vacillating internal landscape productively, I don’t handle boredom particularly well. When a task changes from challenging to menial, I can usually continue to do it if there’s some sense of obligation or misplaced duty attached, but even then, the time until I start throwing objects related to the job at hand against the wall is strictly limited. I’m hoping that the freeform nature of this course will allow me the wiggle room to task manage and avoid running into this problem too frequently.</p>
    <p>I think that the logical thing to follow up all this introspection is some boat building stories (it will make sense, I promise). In the summer of ‘21-22, myself and my friends Nat and Gabe (who are twins) purchased a 34 foot kauri sloop called Prospect (I funded about 5% of the acquisition, and the twins were good for the other 95%). She was a fine vessel, made in the classic “Stewart 34” design (a popular home-build racing yacht in 1980’s New Zealand), but was a fixer-upper. Gabe crewed a similar sized vessel passage sailing from Picton to Tauranga the week before the purchase of the boat, and confident that this was adequate skipping experience, sailed it up from Auckland to Whangarei where it was hauled onto a dry dock where it would remain for close to two months while we carried out the necessary maintenance with our friend Josh. Josh was a german backpacker about 10 years older than me I had met in Taumarunui while walking Te Araroa the summer prior. He seemed like he had his head screwed on straight, and got along well with everyone while we were home in Wellington for new years. Just prior to this boat building scheme, he had lived with the three of us for a few months, so we were confident that he would be a good addition to our team for this particular flight of fancy. </p>
    <p>Regrettably, it is now apparent that this was a significant error. The work was hard, ten or twelve hours a day in direct sun down at the shipyard. The tasks were unfamiliar, and required handling a lot of rather nasty industrial chemicals to boot. I can now attest to the fact that wearing a respirator for hours at a time in 28 degree heat is slightly uncomfortable. There’s something about the way that sweat, rubber and fiberglass/epoxy dust interact that is not only itchy, but associated with the disquieting sense that you are shortening your lifespan by letting this schmutz touch your bare skin. There was something about the whole process that had Josh ill at ease; most undertakings were punctuated by him raising concerns related to the efficacy or safety of our methods. These were usually reasonably rational and well-founded to begin with, but as the days grew longer and hotter they would devolve to paranoid and downright abusive. After a few weeks, the problem grew so severe that one of us would go around fibreglassing patches on the deck and Josh would follow almost directly behind peeling them off, reviewing them, and sticking them back on in a sorrier state than they were before. Needless to say, we weren’t hitting out productivity targets anymore.</p>
    <p>Gabe, the one with a week's skipping experience and consequently the de-facto captain and project manager tried to resolve the problem in good faith, which seemed initially effective. Josh was very apologetic about his behavior, but within minutes had begun frantically repainting a pair of hatches for the cockpit that had been completed only hours before, effectively destroying the paintwork by reducing it to a layer of vile two-part epoxy a centimeter thick. It was with great difficulty we collectively managed to withhold the remark that he was not, in fact, operating with characteristic German efficiency. Unfortunately, this problem had now led us to an impasse - we were finding ourselves unable to make progress as a team. Fortunately, a solution soon presented itself. Josh became obsessed with our alleged need for a gimbal stove - if you’re not familiar with what a gimbal is, it’s essentially a series of concentric rings attached at alternating axes like a gyroscope. The idea is that a central object can move freely with gravitational forces while suspended within the gimbal, so in this use case, a stove can remain level according to gravity’s influence while an object it’s connected to (the boat) moves according to other forces (waves). While not necessary, it would be nice to have, so I suggested to Gabe that he give Josh a budget to engineer and build a gimbal for our galley. I figured that even if what he produced would probably be useless (it was) at least it would keep him out of our hair so we could focus on getting the Prospect seaworthy. Gabe agreed, and our misdirection kept Josh happy for long enough to finish our repairs. </p>
    <p>Prior to the Prospect’s maiden voyage, we mutually decided that Josh needed a talking to to ensure he wouldn’t behave as a crewmate the same way he did in the yard. Again, this seemed to go over pretty well at the time. Josh resolved to treat everyone with more respect, and especially to defer to the captain’s orders while under sail. Although he agreed to these things in earnest, in hindsight it was clear that this couldn’t be the case no matter how hard he tried. As the voyage continued, it gradually became clear that Josh was mortifyingly afraid of the open ocean. When we’d get the Prospect on a nice keel, he’d begin fiddling incessantly with the sheets muttering something to the effect of “I don’t know if the boat is supposed to lean over this much, man.” Anytime Gabe would call for a forsail change from the small Jib to the larger Genoa, he’d hesitate, making a case for why it was too windy to get under a large sail today (in any but the most windless conditions, nonetheless.) After about a week of sailing, the poor guy’s nerves were shot. While we were all trying to get some sleep in our berths, Josh would be frantically patrolling the decks through the night in a vain attempt to secure any piece of chandlery that might make a noise when disturbed by wind or wave. Despite the protests of disturbed sleep from his disgruntled crewmates, he wouldn’t - or perhaps couldn’t - stop himself. Josh had lost the plot.</p>
    <p>By the time we’d sailed the Prospect from Whangarei to Opua, we knew something would have to give. We left Josh aboard the Prospect at the Opua marina one day and took a stroll down to the dairy to put our heads together. Josh was making our passage a nightmare, and unfortunately it seemed as if he might be on the verge of some kind of a nervous breakdown. We knew a big storm was about to blow through, so we thought it best to leave Prospect on the mooring and head down to Nat and Gabe’s mum’s place in Whangarei to regroup. However, this didn’t solve our crewmate problem. We’d already tried to intervene in good faith with Josh, but it was apparent he was going to have to go. A couple of days prior, coming around Cape Brett, he’d been adjusting the mainsail during a particularly tense jibing maneuver, and directly disobeying captain’s orders had ripped the mainsail by vastly over tightening the sheet. At this point it was becoming clear that Josh’s inability to follow instructions was in fact dangerous, but we all felt pretty bad for him given that he seemed genuinely unable to remedy his behavior. Ultimately, unable to tackle the problem head on, we decided upon a more machiavellian solution. We would tell Josh that following the storm we were going to come back, grab the Prospect, and moor it in Auckland, concluding our sailing season. In reality we would sail the boat to Auckland, say our goodbyes, and then head out to the Hauraki Gulf and Great Barrier Island with Josh none the wiser. I’m not proud that this is the solution we used, but it went off without a hitch and taught me a valuable lesson to boot: ultimately, an unethical decision sometimes can lead to a better outcome for everyone. Josh enjoyed the rest of his summer getting to know his new girlfriend at the time, who he’s still with as far as I’m aware. Meanwhile, the twins and I finally got to enjoy the fruits of our labour without the oppressive stress of sharing a 6 square meter cabin with a guy who’s losing his marbles from being in a constant state of mortal terror. I would say that, realpolitik aside, that’s a win-win.</p>
    <p>I’m not sure exactly what recounting this says about me, but I’m not certain that it’s entirely flattering. But it is honest. I think that for the most part I make an effort to treat people decently and handle my problems transparently and ethically. Sometimes, when the success or failure of the mission depends on it, I’ll renege on these values. I see this as more amoral than strictly immoral, but I’m not going to go full Raskolnikov on you and pretend that there is some moral superiority to people who ignore the humanity of others when making decisions for the greater good. People who believe those sorts of things tend to be deranged (which I may well be), and furthermore like to brandish those ideas as a weapon against people who see things differently than them, which is pretty uncool.</p>
