    <p>Understanding that mental faculties specific to a skill can be developed over time can help to lift people’s confidence in their abilities.
       Because of a variety of systematic pressures, people can be led to believe that their mental abilities are an inherent trait rather than one that
        can be developed over time. The revelation that competence in a specific skill can be built by iterating on the processes related to it rather than 
       just learning it by rote according to some inborn ability can be empowering.

    <p>I think that I am very good at leveraging the principles of neuroplasticity when it comes to learning academic and practical skills, but I struggle
       immensely with a fixed mindset in regards to improving my personal and interpersonal emotional skills. I think that the principles of neuroplasticity
        could inform my ongoing efforts to form more useful behavioral and cognitive patterns.

      Cultivating a “growth mindset” through which you try a variety of new skills to challenge yourself and your thinking is a great way to work out the brain
     and develop neuroplasticity. The best way to create new synaptic pathways is by extending yourself and trying new things!

  <h1 class="orange-heading-2">What is a Growth Mindset?</h1>
  <div  class="text-box-fill">
    <p>
      A “growth mindset” is a model of learning and cognition that is both informed by and develops neuroplasticity. A growth mindset is essentially being willing
      to face challenges and setbacks while developing skills. Adopting this mindset can help to align learning processes with the practices that encourage
     neuroplasticity. A learning process that is centered on pushing the boundaries of your abilities will develop new synaptic pathways and allow you to leverage
     neuroplasticity!

      I was surprised to learn that the principle of neuroplasticity plays a major role in the long term recovery of stroke victims. The neurological process through
     which backup synaptic pathways can adapt to the increased load following damage to the primary pathways over very prolonged usage, and that model’s broader
     implications for cognitive development are very interesting.

  <h1 class ="orange-heading-2">How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>
  <p class ="text-box-fill">
   I think that the holistic design of the dev academy curriculum will present a variety of challenges across myriad fields, some of which will be comfortable for me
    to engage with in a challenging way, and others not so much. Trying to maintain a growth mindset while I engage with some of the material on the edge of my comfort
     zone will be an important strategy to get the most out of the experience. As I mentioned earlier, I can find it difficult to engage with materials related to
      emotional development in earnest, which means that I don’t benefit from them as much as I could. I think that taking the time to examine why I am finding a task
       challenging and developing the processes I use to deal with those challenges can be a useful tool for getting the most out of the curriculum.
